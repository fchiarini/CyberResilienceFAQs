Eventually the FAQs will be organized into sections by topic.
But for now they are just random

Editors Note:
should we anchor/bookmark questions?
Can template do it? or do we need to put html inline -

### <a id="whatIsCyberResilience">What is Cyber Resilience?</a>

There are two definitions that help frame Cyber Resilience in the right context, depending if the stakeholders come from the business or the technical world.

Business world - Cyber Resilience is an outcome of Cyber Security and Operational Resilience and is defined as “the ability of an organization to transcend any stresses, failures, hazards and threats to its cyber resources within the organization and its ecosystem, such that the organization can confidently pursue its mission, enable its culture and maintain its desired way of operating” (WEF, 2022). 

Technical world - Cyber Resilience is an extension of Cyber Security and is defined as “the ability to anticipate, withstand, recover from, and adapt to adverse conditions, stresses, attacks, or compromises on systems that use or are enabled by cyber resources. Cyber resiliency is intended to enable mission or business objectives that depend on cyber resources to be achieved in a contested cyber environment.” (NIST 800-160 v2 r1).
Cyber Resilience is grounded on NIST 800-160 v2 r1 and MITRE CREF (the most authoritative industry resources known nowadays). 

### What are the differences between Cyber Resilience and Cyber Security?

Cyber Resilience is an overlap and extension of traditional Cyber Security.
There are four key differences between the two (source: www.highvaluetarget.org).

Difference #1:
 Cybersecurity encompasses a wide set of controls from NIST 800-53 r5 (by definition, a set of security baseline controls), roughly 1100 controls.
Cyber resilience aims to extend the depth at which a small set of controls are designed and then perform (this set of controls is outlined in NIST 800-53 but NIST 800-160 and 800-172 expand these), roughly 200 controls.

Difference #2:
Cybersecurity focuses on protecting all assets, with special focus on high value assets (business view).
Cyber resilience focuses on protecting primarily high value targets (adversary view).

Difference #3:
Cybersecurity focuses on “severe but plausible” threat scenarios against adversaries who go after the less protected and the most vulnerable – NIST 800-53 controls allow to provide adequate protection against these.
Cyber resilience focuses on “extreme but plausible” threat scenarios against adversaries who may pivot from primary organizational impacts to secondary impacts potentially causing unknown harm to the organization as a whole – NIST 800-160 and NIST 800-172 provide the needed techniques and approaches which have corresponding controls in NIST 800-53 r5 however at a deeper level of detail.

Difference #4:
Cybersecurity focuses on reducing likelihood of occurrence as well as reducing likelihood of impact through the application of security frameworks such as the NIST CSF. Security is about keeping adversary from doing harm.
Cyber resilience focuses on reducing magnitude of impact which can be achieved by specific security architecture and engineering practices such as MITRE CREF. Resiliency recognizes harm may occur and how to maximize mission achievement despite that.
